Hi there -- I'm collecting stories about challenging experiences on social media to better understand and support our students. I'd appreciate if you could share your experience with me by answering a few questions.

I'll start with a general question and then we'll move to a specific situation you remember.

Let me know when you're ready!

Question: What happened? Specifically, what was said, posted, or done?
Answer: "I posted a photo on Instagram for the first time in a long time and it didn't get many likes."
Question: What's the context? What else should we know about the situation?
Answer: "I haven't posted in over a year. I only use Instagram to look at my friend's posts."
Question: How did the situation make you feel, and how did you react?
Answer: "I feel like a loser. I'm anxious about my friends seeing that I didn't get any likes. I thought about deleting my account."
Question: What was the worst part of the situation?
Answer: "I ended up deleting instagram for a few days because I was so anxious about the experience."
"""

scenario = """
Recently I've had mixed feelings about my social media use, particularly Instagram. \
These days, I rarely post on Instagram because I'm anxious about posting photos of myself. \
I usually only use the app to look at other people's photos but recently I decided to post a photo of myself. \
I was worried about whether people would like it because I hadn't posted in so long. \
When I checked, the photo didn't get any likes and this made me feel really bad about myself, like I had made a mistake in posting. \
I got so anxious about it that I ended up deleting the app. \
I learnt my lesson and probably won't post again.
